        <h2>My favorite books.</h2>
        <p>
          These four books offer a mix of inspiration, knowledge, and deep
          storytelling. "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho takes readers on a
          magical journey of self-discovery, emphasizing the importance of
          following one's dreams. "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by
          Yuval Noah Harari provides a captivating look at human evolution,
          culture, and how we came to shape the world. "The Monk Who Sold His
          Ferrari" by Robin Sharma is a transformative tale about finding true
          happiness and purpose in life. Meanwhile, "To Kill a Mockingbird" by
          Harper Lee is a powerful novel that explores themes of morality,
          justice, and human empathy through the eyes of a young girl in the
          American South. Each of these books leaves a lasting impact and offers
          valuable lessons for readers.

        <h2>Favorite Foods.</h2>
        <p>
          When it comes to food, I have a soft spot for spicy Indian cuisine,
          comforting Italian pasta, and indulgent desserts. Whether it's the
          rich flavors of a butter chicken curry, the cheesy goodness of a
          classic lasagna, or the sweet decadence of a chocolate lava cake,
          these dishes never fail to satisfy my cravings and lift my spirits.:

        <h3><Why These Are My Favorites></h3>
        <p>
          I love playing cricket, reading books, and chatting with people
          because they bring excitement, knowledge, and connection into my life.
          Cricket is my passionâ€”it keeps me active, sharpens my skills, and
          teaches me teamwork and discipline. Reading books allows me to explore
          new worlds, gain wisdom, and expand my perspective on life. Chatting
          with people is something I truly enjoy because it helps me learn from
          different experiences, build relationships, and share ideas. These
          three hobbies keep me engaged, constantly learning, and make my life
          more enjoyable.
